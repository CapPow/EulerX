# Introduction

Euler is an open source toolkit (mostly written in Python) for merging taxonomies (taxonomical organized datasets) and visualizing the results. (see [Euler Toolkit Wiki][wiki] for more information, and the remaining issue list in [Jira][jira])

We have all the EulerFO source code, EulerASP source code, and a bunch of use cases in this toolkit. EulerFO is a modified version of CleanTax which was firstly developed by Dave Thau. CleanTax/EulerFO are built upon Prover9/Mace4 reasoning software. EulerASP is a brand new taxonomy reasoning tool that Mingmin built from scratch. EulerASP is built based on popular ASP reasoners DLV and Potassco. This readme page is mainly focusing on the use of EulerASP.

Euler is designed for UNIX-like operating systems (Linux, Mac, etc). If you are running on Windows, you need to install a virtual machine to run Euler.

# Installation Instructions For Users

##### 1. First-time user for git
Before using Euler/X, you need to download it from this git repo. You can first check the installation of git.

    $ git —-version

If you are a first-time user for git, please download and install it [http://git-scm.com/downloads/].

##### 2. Clone the repository of git into local disk (The new command line interface is in `forcli` branch now)

    $ git clone -b “forcli” https://github.com/EulerProject/EulerX.git

##### 3. Check the installation of Python
Euler/X is written in **Python**, so it requires Python2.X or later installed in your computer. 

    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.8

Installation of Python2 can be found at [https://www.python.org/downloads/].

##### 4. Check the installation of reasoner
Euler/X use either **DLV** or **Gringo** as underlining reasoner. Please install them and make sure they are in your PATH:

    $ dlv --version
    DLV [build BEN/Dec 17 2012   gcc 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)]
    
    usage: dlv {FRONTEND} {OPTIONS} [filename [filename [...]]]
    
    Specify -help for more detailed usage information.
    
    
    $ gringo --version
    gringo 3.0.3

    License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
    Gringo is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
    There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
    
    $ claspD --version
    claspD - Version: 1.1.4
    Copyright (C) Benjamin Kaufmann, Christian Drescher
    This software is provided "as is" without expressed or implied warranty,
    and with no claim as to its suitability for any purpose.

To install DLV, please use the version `static no ODBC support` from [DLV download page][dlv].
To install Gringo, please use the version [3.0.3][gringo303] (avoid the latest one to change the syntax).
To install ClaspD, please use the version [1.1.4][claspD114] (avoid the latest one to change the syntax).
Note: You do not need to install all to use Euler/X, either DLV or Gringo+ClaspD will do the job.

##### 5. Install Graphviz visualization tool
All knowledge products generated by Euler/X use Graphviz for rendering visualizations, to check the installation of it:

    $ dot -V
    dot - graphviz version 2.36.0 (20140111.2315)

Installation of Graphviz can be found at [http://www.graphviz.org/].

##### 6. Install parser module
The Euler/X command line interface 2.0 use python module `docopt` as the parser generator. Use pip to install it:

    $ pip install docopt==0.6.1

Installation of pip can be found at [https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html].
To get more about `docopt`, please check [http://docopt.org/].

##### 7. Install stylesheet module
Euler/X use python module `yaml` for representing graph and stylesheet files. Install it [here][pyyaml]

##### 8. **[IMPORTANT]** You need to make sure your machine has met the minimal software requirements before run Euler.
Please run `installCheck.sh` and make sure the minimal dependency check passes before running this toolkit.
Make sure all commands of running softwares before and main entry of source code (e.g. `src-el/` of EulerASP) are in your PATH env.
Note: [Prover9/Mace4][p9m4] is not necessary to install if you do not want to use EulerFO.

# Examples of Running Euler2 with new command line interface. Use example [abstract4][https://github.com/EulerProject/EulerX/blob/forcli/example/abstract4/abstract4.txt]

##### 1. Show the available commands
List all usage commands.

    $ euler2 -h

##### 2. Check the input file
Check the validity of input file, including “multiple roots per taxonomy”, “multiple parents per child”, “unmatched leaves (leaves that are not involved in any articulations)”.

    $ euler2 check abstract4.txt

##### 3. Run taxonomic alignment problem
The main task for Euler/X, you can suggest the encoding method, the reasoning tool, options to switch on/off coverage and sibling disjointness, et al.

    $ euler2 align abstract4.txt

##### 4. Show the input visualization
TO show the input visualization of the last run (the same as the following **show** commands), need to do “euler2 align” first. The result will be in `0-Input/` folder.

    $ euler2 show iv

##### 5. Show the possible worlds
The result will be in `4-PWs/` folder

    $ euler2 show pw

##### 6. Show the aggregate view
The result will be in `5-Aggregates/` folder

    $ euler2 show av

##### 7. Show the cluster view
The result will be in `5-Aggregates/` folder

    $ euler2 show cv

##### 8. Show the hierarchy view
The result will be in `5-Aggregates/` folder

    $ euler2 show hv
