This repo has two branches: master and main.
The "master" branch is the "released" branch, which is stable and tested, but may not be the latest.
The "main" branch is the "development" branch, which has the latest code.

So, everybody please do the commits ONLY to "main" branch. Once we have tested and we make sure the code is ready to be released, we can merge it to "master" branch. Thanks!
